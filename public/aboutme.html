        <h1>About Me - Mustaq Hussain Syed</h1>
        <p>
            I am Mustaq Hussain Syed, a passionate final-year BTech student majoring in 
            Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Srinivasa Ramanujan Institute of Technology. 
            With a strong foundation in both hardware and software, I thrive on building real-world solutions using 
            modern technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an AI Engineering Intern, I’ve contributed to deploying machine learning models 
            and developing intelligent systems. I’m skilled in Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and 
            JavaScript, and I've built projects ranging from a full-fledged banking system to 
            a smart product expiry tracker.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my most innovative creations is the private social media platform 
            "Room", which promotes focused and private conversations with unique features like 
            voting-based room entry and strict privacy controls.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m also exploring robotics, ROS, SLAM, and real-time traffic management systems using 
            AI. My goal is to blend creativity and technology to develop solutions that make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            I strive to be a part of forward-thinking teams where I can grow, contribute, and innovate continuously. 
            Let’s build the future — one idea at a time.
        </p>
